<p>Prevent Digestive Cancers Through Diet and Lifestyle Choices</p>
</center>

üìÜ Join our book club every Monday at 12:00 PM during our regular
[Meatless Monday Lunch]({% link _posts/2024-08-22-meatless-monday-2024-fall.markdown %}),
near the stairs on the 2nd floor of CCT.

Chapter 4 focuses on preventing digestive cancers,
including colorectal,
pancreatic,
and esophageal cancers,
by making mindful dietary and lifestyle choices.
Dr. Greger emphasizes that what we eat can significantly impact our cancer risk.

## ü•¶ Colorectal Cancer Prevention

This chapter reveals that colorectal cancer is one of the most common but treatable cancers if detected early.
Regular screenings from age 50 to 75 are recommended,
but prevention through diet is even better.

1. **Turmeric and Curcumin Benefits:** Turmeric,
commonly used in Indian cuisine,
contains curcumin,
which may help prevent cancerous polyps in the colon and reduce existing polyps with minimal side effects.

2. **Fiber Importance:** High fiber intake is linked to reduced colorectal cancer risk.
Populations with high fiber diets have significantly lower cancer rates than those with low fiber intake.

3. **Phytates as Protectors:** Phytates,
found in whole grains,
beans,
nuts,
and seeds,
may prevent cancer cell growth and protect against colorectal cancer through their antioxidant,
anti-inflammatory,
and immune-enhancing properties.

## üçó Pancreatic Cancer Prevention

Pancreatic cancer is highly lethal,
with most patients surviving less than a year post-diagnosis.
Prevention through diet is critical.

1. **Avoid Animal Fats:** Consuming fats from animal sources is linked to increased pancreatic cancer risk,
unlike fats from plant sources.

2. **Risks of Poultry Consumption:** Poultry consumption,
especially in high amounts,
is associated with a significant increase in pancreatic cancer risk,
possibly due to cancer-causing viruses found in chickens.

3. **Curcumin for Treatment:** Curcumin has shown promise in halting tumor progression in some pancreatic cancer patients without adverse effects,
suggesting a role in treatment.

## ü•ï Esophageal Cancer Prevention

Esophageal cancer is deadly,
often caused by acid reflux and lifestyle factors.
Prevention focuses on reducing acid reflux through diet and avoiding smoking and alcohol.

1. **Manage Acid Reflux:** Diet plays a crucial role in managing acid reflux,
a significant risk factor for esophageal cancer.
Avoiding high-fat meals,
red meat,
and processed foods can help.

2. **Fiber and Plant-Based Diet:** A high-fiber,
plant-based diet helps prevent acid reflux and its complications,
reducing esophageal cancer risk.

3. **Berries as Protective Agents:** Consuming berries,
such as strawberries,
has been shown to potentially reverse precancerous lesions in the esophagus.

## üåø Key Takeaway

Preventing digestive cancers involves focusing on a plant-based diet rich in fiber,
antioxidants,
and anti-inflammatory compounds,
while avoiding processed foods,
red meat,
and alcohol.
Integrating spices like turmeric and foods like beans,
berries,
and whole grains into daily meals offers natural protection against these life-threatening cancers. üå±
