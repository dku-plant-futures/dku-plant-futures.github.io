On **Wednesday, September 11**, Plant Futures at Duke Kunshan University
hosted a screening of the BBC documentary **"Should I Eat Meat?"** presented by Dr. Michael Mosley.
We were thrilled to see an unexpected number of attendees join us for this eye-opening film! 🎥🍿

## About Michael Mosley 🕊️

[Michael Mosley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mosley),
who sadly passed away on **June 5, 2024**,
was a renowned British journalist, producer, and presenter famous for his documentaries on science,
medicine, and health.
Originally trained as a doctor, Mosley transitioned to television, where he
skillfully combined meticulous research with engaging storytelling.

## Key Takeaways

### Meat’s Nutritional Benefits 🥩

Red meat, such as beef and lamb, is an excellent source of high-quality protein, iron,
zinc, and vitamin B12—all essential for maintaining muscle, blood cell health, and overall
energy levels. However, while meat offers these vital nutrients, plant-based diets can
also provide them if carefully planned, emphasizing variety and balance.

### Health Risks of Red and Processed Meats 🚨

Studies discussed in the documentary highlight significant health risks associated with
the regular consumption of red and processed meats (like bacon, sausages, and ham). These
include an increased risk of heart disease, certain cancers (particularly colorectal
cancer), and premature mortality. The potential culprits behind these risks are saturated
fats, sodium nitrites, and other compounds found in processed meats, which may contribute
to cancer and cardiovascular problems.

### The Conflicting Evidence Around Red Meat Consumption ❓

While some studies suggest that even moderate consumption of red meat could slightly
increase health risks, others, like the EPIC study, found no significant effect on
mortality when red meat is consumed in low to moderate amounts. This suggests that the
risks may vary depending on preparation methods, portion sizes, and overall dietary
patterns.

### Michael Mosley’s Experiment and Results 🧪

As part of the documentary, Mosley adopted a high-meat diet, doubling the advised daily
intake. Within a month, his cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and body fat all increased
significantly, demonstrating how even short-term dietary changes can impact health
markers.

### A Balanced, Predominantly Plant-Based Approach 🌿

Experts in the documentary recommend a diet that is mostly plant-based, with moderate
consumption of lean, unprocessed meats. A few portions of lean meat per week (up to 100
grams each) can be part of a healthy diet, especially when balanced with a variety of
fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. For those reducing meat, it's crucial to
avoid replacing it with unhealthy processed foods high in sugar or refined carbohydrates.
The goal is to maintain a balanced intake of proteins, healthy fats, and essential
vitamins and minerals.

## Our Opinion: Updated Insights on Plant-Based Nutrition 🌱

While this documentary was produced in 2014 and provided a balanced view on meat
consumption, nutrition science has continued to evolve. Today, there is a 
[consensus](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrition-overview-0)
among nutrition scientists that "well-planned vegan diets can support healthy living in people of all ages".
The only exceptions are **iron and B12**, which require careful consideration.

### Iron and B12 Supplements

For those following a vegan diet, it is essential to take supplements for iron and vitamin
B12, as these are not easily found in plant-based foods in sufficient amounts.

### The Origin of B12

It's also worth [noting](https://www.forksoverknives.com/wellness/vitamin-b12-questions-answered-2/) that even the B12 found in animal meat often comes from supplements
given to animals, as they do not naturally produce B12 any more than humans do. Therefore,
taking a direct B12 supplement as a human is equally effective and environmentally more
sustainable.

## What’s Next? 🤔

For those interested in a more comprehensive and updated guide to nutrition, we highly
recommend **Dr. Michael Greger’s book "How Not To Die"**. It provides detailed information
on how a plant-based diet can help prevent and reverse many chronic diseases and is a
great resource for anyone looking to improve their dietary habits with the latest
scientific research.
We are currently running a (very loosely) organized [book club]({% link _posts/2024-08-26-how-not-to-die-intro.markdown %}) on it.
