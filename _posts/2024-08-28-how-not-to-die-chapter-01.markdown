Our book club is back next Monday, September 2, 2024! We'll dive into Chapter 1 of *How Not to Die From Heart Disease*.

This chapter tackles heart disease, America's top killer, responsible for nearly 400,000 deaths each year. Dr. Michael Greger highlights that heart disease is mostly preventable and even reversible with the right diet. He explains that atherosclerosis (which is the buildup of plaque in the arteries) starts early in life, mainly due to high cholesterol from animal products and processed foods. The chapter busts the myth that heart disease is just a part of aging, pointing out that some populations with plant-based diets have very low rates of heart disease.

Dr. Greger also shares how unhealthy meals can affect artery function almost immediately. For example, a single fast-food meal can stiffen your arteries within hours.

He compares the limits and potential side effects of statin drugs (medications used to lower cholesterol) with the benefits of a whole food, plant-based diet for preventing and reversing heart disease. Studies show that dietary changes can improve heart health quickly, with significant reductions in angina attacks (chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart) for those who switch to a plant-based diet. The chapter ends by discussing how food industry lobbying impacts dietary guidelines and medical education. Dr. Greger stresses the need for better nutrition education and the crucial role of diet in heart health, arguing that a plant-based diet can treat existing heart disease, not just prevent it.

# üèÜ Trivia

**Which of the following statements are true?**

* Heart disease is the leading cause of death in America.
* Atherosclerosis starts in childhood.
* Statin drugs are completely safe with no side effects.
* A plant-based diet can reverse heart disease.
* A single fast-food meal has no immediate impact on artery function.

**Answer correctly and get a treat!**

# America's Top Killer

**Statement:** Heart disease is the leading cause of death in America.

**Answer:** ‚òëÔ∏è

**Explanation:** Heart disease kills nearly 400,000 Americans each year, which is about one person every 83 seconds, making it America's top killer.

# Early Onset of Atherosclerosis

**Statement:** Atherosclerosis starts in childhood.

**Answer:** ‚òëÔ∏è

**Explanation:** Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fatty deposits (plaque) in the arteries, which starts early in life. Studies show that fatty streaks, the earliest sign of atherosclerosis, are common in American children by age ten. Autopsies of young accident victims also link high cholesterol with arterial atherosclerosis.

# Safety of Statin Drugs

**Statement:** Statin drugs are completely safe with no side effects.

**Answer:** ‚ùå

**Explanation:** Statins, which are medications used to lower cholesterol, can have side effects such as liver or muscle damage. They may also cause memory issues and increase the risk of diabetes.

# Reversing Heart Disease

**Statement:** A plant-based diet can reverse heart disease.

**Answer:** ‚òëÔ∏è

**Explanation:** Doctors like Nathan Pritikin and Dean Ornish have shown that plant-based diets can reverse heart disease. Plant-based diets lower cholesterol as effectively as statins but without the associated risks.

# Immediate Effects of Fast Food

**Statement:** A single fast-food meal has no immediate impact on artery function.

**Answer:** ‚ùå

**Explanation:** Studies show that just one fast-food meal can stiffen arteries within hours, reducing their ability to relax and leading to chronic low-grade inflammation in many Americans.
