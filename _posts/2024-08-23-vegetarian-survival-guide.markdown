Introduction
============

This document is provided by the DKU (Duke Kunshan University) Plant-Futures Club as a
resource for individuals who are vegetarians, vegans, or those interested in incorporating
more plant-based foods into their diet. 

If you have any suggestions or would like to report a closure of a restaurant,
please email us at [xingshi.cai@dukekunshan.edu.cn](mailto:xingshi.cai@dukekunshan.edu.cn)
or leave comment at the end of this post.

Eating at University Community Center
=====================================

Third Floor (Chinese Food)
--------------------------

The canteen management is committed to offering vegetarian options with proteins for both
lunch and dinner. These options are available in both the Weigh-and-Pay and A-la-carte
sections.

Second Floor
------------

Now there is a salad bar on the second floor from which you can choose vegetarian
ingredients.
Note that among the three sauces provided, only the oil and vinegar dressing (油醋汁) is vegan.

First/Ground Floor
------------------

From Aug 26, 2024, hotpot with tomato-base vegetarian soup is available on the first floor.

Baguette bread available on this floor is diary-free and egg-free, while the
bagel bread contains egg. The vegetarian sandwich may include cheese and
diary-based sauce, but a vegetables-only version can be requested. Oat
diary is available as a substitute for diary in coffee, at an additional
cost of 2 yuan.

The salad section now also sells fruit and vegetable cups.

You can request vegetarian noodles with the option to add a Tofu (素鸡) topping.
However, the broth usually poured on the noodles is not vegetarian.
You should ask for pure water instead of the broth.

FamilyMart
----------

In the baozi/steamed bun (包子) section, two vegetarian options are available: one with
cabbage and mushroom fillings and another with sweet taro filling.

The Guandong Zhu (关东煮), or Kanto-ni in Japanese, offers vegetarian skewers, but it is
important to note that the broth is fish-based.

Additionally, plant-based protein snacks labelled as veggie meat (素肉) or dried-tofu
(豆腐干) may be found on the shelves. (Note that they are not always available.)

## By Restaurant Type

### Noodle Restaurants

Noodle shops can serve as a convenient option for vegans. The noodles are cooked in plain
water, making them inherently vegan. While most toppings may not be vegan-friendly,
alternatives such as Veggie Chicken (素鸡) or firm-textured tofu are often available. If
vegan options are not explicitly mentioned on the menu, it is advisable to request a bowl
of veggie noodles from the staff, who are usually willing to accommodate. For those
traveling, noodle shops offer a flexible dining choice that can be easily customized to
fit vegan dietary needs.

### Hotpot Restaurants

Hotpot (火锅) is a traditional Chinese dish that has gained international popularity,
including in Canada and Europe. Originating from Sichuan province, it involves a simmering
pot of broth on a stove, into which ingredients are placed for cooking before consumption.
While the broth is often beef-based, mushroom-based alternatives are available, and there
is also the option to use pure water. The dish offers a range of vegan-friendly
ingredients, including several types of tofu and vegetables.

### North-Western Restaurants

Liangpi (凉皮) is a Chinese dish featuring cold skin noodles made from either wheat or
rice flour. Originating from north-western China, it has become popular nationwide and is
commonly found in north-western style restaurants like Xibei (西贝). The dish is usually
vegan and is served with cucumber and purple cabbage shreds, along with condiments like
chili oil, vinegar, and soy sauce.

### Breakfast Restaurants

Baozi (包子), steamed buns with various fillings, are a common breakfast option in China.
While many fillings are meat-based, vegan options like vegetable and mushroom fillings are
available.

### Dumpling Restaurants

Dumplings are made from dough, typically wheat-based, and filled with combinations of
meat, vegetables, and sometimes egg. They can be boiled, steamed, or fried. Vegetarian
options are common, but those on a strict vegan diet should be cautious as vegetarian
dumplings often contain egg.

### Skewer Restaurants 

Skewers in China are enjoyed grilled, fried, or boiled in spicy sauce. Each skewer usually
contains a single type of ingredient, allowing for easy customization for a vegan meal.
Notable fast-food skewer places include Kuafu Fried Skewers (夸父炸串) for fried options
and Yanhuo Makes Skewers (烟火成串) for BBQ skewers.

### Other Restaurants 

Standard restaurants often offer a variety of vegan dishes, including:

1. **Mapo Tofu (素麻婆豆腐)**: A spicy and savoury tofu dish, traditionally made with
   ground pork, but can be prepared without meat for a vegan version.
2. **Three Treasures of the Earth (地三鲜)**: A hearty stir-fry featuring eggplant,
   potatoes, and green peppers, often in a savoury sauce.
3. **Dry Fried Beans (干煸四季豆)**: Crispy green beans stir-fried with garlic and spices,
   offering a satisfying crunch.
4. **Garlic Broccoli (蒜蓉西蓝花)**: A simple yet flavorful dish of broccoli sauteed with
   garlic, highlighting the freshness of the vegetable.
5. **Sweet and Sour Cabbage (酸甜洋白菜)**: A tangy and sweet cabbage dish, balancing
   flavors for a delightful side.
6. **Sauteed Bok Choy (清炒小白菜)**: A light and healthy stir-fry of tender bok choy,
   seasoned simply to let the vegetable shine.
7. **Chinese Scallion Pancakes (葱油饼)**: Crispy, flaky pancakes infused with the mild
   spice of scallions, perfect as a snack or side dish. Note that these sold in grocery
   store often contains lard.
8. **Shredded Potato Stir-Fry (土豆丝)**: Thinly shredded potatoes stir-fried to a tender
   crisp, often seasoned with vinegar and chili for a tangy kick.
9. **Braised Tofu (红烧豆腐)**: Tofu braised in a rich, savoury sauce, often with mushrooms
   and other vegetables.
10. **Eggplant in Garlic Sauce (鱼香茄子)**: Soft, tender eggplant cooked in a fragrant
    garlic sauce, typically sweet and slightly spicy.
