Introduction
============

This document is provided by the DKU (Duke Kunshan University) Plant-Futures Club as a resource for individuals who are vegetarians, vegans, or those interested in incorporating more plant-based foods into their diet. 

If you have any suggestions or would like to report a closure of a restaurant,
please [email us](mailto:xingshi.cai@dukekunshan.edu.cn).

Eating at University Community Center
=====================================

Third Floor (Chinese Food)
--------------------------

The canteen management is committed to offering vegetarian options with proteins for both
lunch and dinner. These options are available in both the Weigh-and-Pay and A-la-carte
sections.

Second Floor
------------

Now there is a salad bar on the second floor from which you can choose vegetarian
ingredients. Note that among the three sauces provided, only one is vegan.

First/Ground Floor
------------------

From Aug 26, 2024, hotpot with :tomato:-base vegetarian soup is available on the first floor.

Baguette bread available on this floor is free from :baby_bottle: and :egg:, while the
bagel bread contains :egg:. The vegetarian sandwich may include :cheese: and
:baby_bottle:-based sauce, but a vegetables-only version can be requested. Oat
:baby_bottle: is available as a substitute for :baby_bottle: in coffee, at an additional
cost of 2 yuan.

The salad section now also sells fruit and vegetable cups.

You can ask for vegetarian noodles on the ground floor with the option of adding a Tofu
(素鸡) topping. However, the broth usually poured on the noodles is not vegetarian. You
should ask for pure water instead of the broth.

FamilyMart
----------

In the baozi/steamed bun (包子) section, two vegetarian options are available: one with
cabbage and mushroom fillings and another with sweet taro filling.

The Guandong Zhu (关东煮), or Kanto-ni in Japanese, offers vegetarian skewers, but it is
important to note that the broth is fish-based.

Additionally, plant-based protein snacks labelled as veggie meat (素肉) or dried-tofu
(豆腐干) may be found on the shelves. (Note that they are not always available.)

## By Restaurant Type

### Noodle Restaurants

Noodle shops can serve as a convenient option for vegans. The noodles are cooked in plain water, making them inherently vegan. While most toppings may not be vegan-friendly, alternatives such as Veggie Chicken (素鸡) or firm-textured tofu are often available. If vegan options are not explicitly mentioned on the menu, it is advisable to request a bowl of veggie noodles from the staff, who are usually willing to accommodate. For those traveling, noodle shops offer a flexible dining choice that can be easily customized to fit vegan dietary needs.

### Hotpot Restaurants

Hotpot (火锅) is a traditional Chinese dish that has gained international popularity, including in Canada and Europe. Originating from Sichuan province, it involves a simmering pot of broth on a stove, into which ingredients are placed for cooking before consumption. While the broth is often beef-based, mushroom-based alternatives are available, and there is also the option to use pure water. The dish offers a range of vegan-friendly ingredients, including several types of tofu and vegetables.

### North-Western Restaurants

Liangpi (凉皮) is a Chinese dish featuring cold skin noodles made from either wheat or rice flour. Originating from north-western China, it has become popular nationwide and is commonly found in north-western style restaurants like Xibei (西贝). The dish is usually vegan and is served with cucumber and purple cabbage shreds, along with condiments like chili oil, vinegar, and soy sauce.

### Breakfast Restaurants

Baozi (包子), steamed buns with various fillings, are a common breakfast option in China. While many fillings are meat-based, vegan options like vegetable and mushroom fillings are available.

### Dumpling Restaurants

Dumplings are made from dough, typically wheat-based, and filled with combinations of meat, vegetables, and sometimes :egg:. They can be boiled, steamed, or fried. Vegetarian options are common, but those on a strict vegan diet should be cautious as vegetarian dumplings often contain :egg:.

### Skewer Restaurants 

Skewers in China are enjoyed grilled, fried, or boiled in spicy sauce. Each skewer usually contains a single type of ingredient, allowing for easy customization for a vegan meal. Notable fast-food skewer places include Kuafu Fried Skewers (夸父炸串) for fried options and Yanhuo Makes Skewers (烟火成串) for BBQ skewers.

### Other Restaurants 

Standard restaurants often feature a range of vegan dishes such as Mapo Tofu without ground pork (素麻婆豆腐), Three Treasures of the Earth (地三鲜), Hot and Spicy Soup (麻辣烫), Dry Fried Beans (干煸四季豆), Garlic Broccoli (蒜蓉西蓝花), Sweet and Sour Cabbage (酸甜洋白菜), Sauteed Bok Choy (清炒小白菜), Chinese Scallion Pancakes (葱油饼), and Shredded Potato Stir-Fry (土豆丝). While some dishes like Mapo Tofu traditionally contain meat, it is often possible to request a vegan version.
