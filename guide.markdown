### Third Floor (Chinese Food)

The canteen management is committed to offering vegetarian options with proteins for both
lunch and dinner. These options are available in both the Weigh-and-Pay and A-la-carte
sections.

### Second Floor

Now there is a salad bar on the second floor from which you can choose vegetarian
ingredients.
Note that among the three sauces provided, only the oil and vinegar dressing (油醋汁) is vegan.

At the Teppanyaki section, occasionally your can find fried tofu.
Check the [menu](#the-menus) for more details.

### First/Ground Floor

From Aug 26, 2024, hotpot with tomato-base vegetarian soup is available on the first floor.

Baguette bread available on this floor is diary-free and egg-free, while the
bagel bread contains egg. The vegetarian sandwich may include cheese and
diary-based sauce, but a vegetables-only version can be requested. Oat
diary is available as a substitute for diary in coffee, at an additional
cost of 2 yuan.

The salad section now also sells fruit and vegetable cups.

You can request vegetarian noodles with the option to add a Tofu (素鸡) topping.
However, the broth usually poured on the noodles is not vegetarian.
You should ask for pure water instead of the broth.

### FamilyMart

In the baozi/steamed bun (包子) section, two vegetarian options are available: one with
cabbage and mushroom fillings and another with sweet taro filling.

The Guandong Zhu (关东煮), or Kanto-ni in Japanese, offers vegetarian skewers, but it is
important to note that the broth is fish-based.

Additionally, plant-based protein snacks labelled as veggie meat (素肉) or dried-tofu
(豆腐干) may be found on the shelves. (Note that they are not always available.)

### By Restaurant Type

#### Noodle Restaurants

Noodle shops can serve as a convenient option for vegans. The noodles are cooked in plain
water, making them inherently vegan. While most toppings may not be vegan-friendly,
alternatives such as Veggie Chicken (素鸡) or firm-textured tofu are often available. If
vegan options are not explicitly mentioned on the menu, it is advisable to request a bowl
of veggie noodles from the staff, who are usually willing to accommodate. For those
traveling, noodle shops offer a flexible dining choice that can be easily customized to
fit vegan dietary needs.

#### Hotpot Restaurants

Hotpot (火锅) is a traditional Chinese dish that has gained international popularity,
including in Canada and Europe. Originating from Sichuan province, it involves a simmering
pot of broth on a stove, into which ingredients are placed for cooking before consumption.
While the broth is often beef-based, mushroom-based alternatives are available, and there
is also the option to use pure water. The dish offers a range of vegan-friendly
ingredients, including several types of tofu and vegetables.

#### North-Western Restaurants

Liangpi (凉皮) is a Chinese dish featuring cold skin noodles made from either wheat or
rice flour. Originating from north-western China, it has become popular nationwide and is
commonly found in north-western style restaurants like Xibei (西贝). The dish is usually
vegan and is served with cucumber and purple cabbage shreds, along with condiments like
chili oil, vinegar, and soy sauce.

#### Breakfast Restaurants

Baozi (包子), steamed buns with various fillings, are a common breakfast option in China.
While many fillings are meat-based, vegan options like vegetable and mushroom fillings are
available.

#### Dumpling Restaurants

Dumplings are made from dough, typically wheat-based, and filled with combinations of
meat, vegetables, and sometimes egg. They can be boiled, steamed, or fried. Vegetarian
options are common, but those on a strict vegan diet should be cautious as vegetarian
dumplings often contain egg.

#### Skewer Restaurants 

Skewers in China are enjoyed grilled, fried, or boiled in spicy sauce. Each skewer usually
contains a single type of ingredient, allowing for easy customization for a vegan meal.
Notable fast-food skewer places include Kuafu Fried Skewers (夸父炸串) for fried options
and Yanhuo Makes Skewers (烟火成串) for BBQ skewers.

#### Other Restaurants 

Standard restaurants often offer a variety of vegan dishes, including:

1. **Mapo Tofu (素麻婆豆腐)**: A spicy and savoury tofu dish, traditionally made with
   ground pork, but can be prepared without meat for a vegan version.
2. **Three Treasures of the Earth (地三鲜)**: A hearty stir-fry featuring eggplant,
   potatoes, and green peppers, often in a savoury sauce.
3. **Dry Fried Beans (干煸四季豆)**: Crispy green beans stir-fried with garlic and spices,
   offering a satisfying crunch.
4. **Garlic Broccoli (蒜蓉西蓝花)**: A simple yet flavorful dish of broccoli sauteed with
   garlic, highlighting the freshness of the vegetable.
5. **Sweet and Sour Cabbage (酸甜洋白菜)**: A tangy and sweet cabbage dish, balancing
   flavors for a delightful side.
6. **Sauteed Bok Choy (清炒小白菜)**: A light and healthy stir-fry of tender bok choy,
   seasoned simply to let the vegetable shine.
7. **Chinese Scallion Pancakes (葱油饼)**: Crispy, flaky pancakes infused with the mild
   spice of scallions, perfect as a snack or side dish. Note that these sold in grocery
   store often contains lard.
8. **Shredded Potato Stir-Fry (土豆丝)**: Thinly shredded potatoes stir-fried to a tender
   crisp, often seasoned with vinegar and chili for a tangy kick.
9. **Braised Tofu (红烧豆腐)**: Tofu braised in a rich, savoury sauce, often with mushrooms
   and other vegetables.
10. **Eggplant in Garlic Sauce (鱼香茄子)**: Soft, tender eggplant cooked in a fragrant
    garlic sauce, typically sweet and slightly spicy.
