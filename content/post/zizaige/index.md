This vegetarian buffet is a celebration of traditional Chinese food, offering
dozens of dishes, including Suzhou-style noodles and the hands-on fun of a DIY
mini-hotpot called Ma La Tang (麻辣烫).

The cost is 38 yuan per person --- a small price for such a variety. For regulars,
you can get 10 meal coupons for 208 yuan, saving a little for future visits.

In the same dining hall, there's a cafe where coffee costs 58 yuan. The barista
assures you this is because the beans are organic, though you might still
wonder. 🤔

The doors open at 11:00am, and it's worth showing up early to enjoy the full
spread. By noon, the best dishes start disappearing, a reminder that even the
most abundant feasts don't last forever.

There's also private dining on the second floor. What goes on up there? Who
knows --- it's a mystery you might choose to solve, or not.

In the evening, the buffet switches gears. It's pay-what-you-want, with fewer
dishes. They suggest a contribution of 20 yuan per person --- a gentle nudge toward
fairness.

And since the restaurant is right next to Tinglin Park (亭林园), a stroll
through the park after your meal is highly recommended. It's the perfect way to
reflect on your food, your day, and the beauty of small, meaningful moments.

Pros: Many options, Reasonable Price, Next to Tinglin Park

Cons: Crowded, Arriving at noon is already a bit late, Expensive coffee
