_Inka_ is a beloved Polish beverage with a history dating back to 1971. It was created as
a natural, caffeine-free alternative to coffee, made from a blend of roasted rye, barley,
chicory, and sugar beets. Known for its mild, earthy sweetness, _Inka_ offers a comforting
drink that is gentle on the stomach and rich in fiber, making it a healthy choice for
those seeking a natural, wholesome beverage. Over the years, _Inka_ has remained a staple
in many households, celebrated for its simplicity and goodness.
