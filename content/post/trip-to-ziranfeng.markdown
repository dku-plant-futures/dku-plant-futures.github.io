After our first successful [food trip to Shanghai]({% post_url

vegetarian options closer to home. Last Sunday (Sep 1), we set our sights on a local gem, [Ziranfeng
Vegetarian Buffet Restaurant / 自然风蔬食自助餐厅]({% link guide.markdown
%}#kunshan--昆山) in Kunshan. Seven of us joined this adventure, making it our largest
group outing yet!

Upon arrival, we were greeted by a bustling scene. The restaurant was filled with locals,
each making their way through a generous spread of dishes. The scent of freshly cooked
food filled the air, and the energy was lively—a real testament to Ziranfeng's popularity
in the community. 

For just 28 yuan per meal (or even less with coupons), it was easy to see why this place draws a crowd. There was an array of choices, each more enticing than the last. Personally, I couldn't resist the crispy fried tofu or the savory pancake with carrots and zucchini. The 干锅土豆 (dry pot potatoes) were a hit at our table, and we all kept going back for the 点心 (pastries) and 炸藕 (fried lotus root). Conversations flowed as we shared our favorites and encouraged each other to try new dishes.

One thing to note is that not all options are vegan. For instance, the milk tea and 韭菜盒子 (chive pockets) contain dairy. It was a good reminder to check the ingredients before filling our plates. But the variety available meant there was still plenty for everyone to enjoy.

As the meal went on, the restaurant’s vibrant energy remained. It's worth mentioning that
it can get quite crowded and a bit noisy, so if you’re someone who enjoys a more serene
setting, visiting after 1 PM might be a better option. But be prepared for a more limited
selection if you choose to go later.

During this trip, we also invited university canteen manager and two chefs to come and try
the vegetarian food. Hopefully they will get some inspirations about how to improve the
vegetarian options at our canteen. :crossed_fingers:
