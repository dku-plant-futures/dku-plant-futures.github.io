## How many animals are in farms?

Every year, we kill somewhere between 400 billion and 3 trillion vertebrates
(e.g. cows, chickens, fish) — some are killed for sport and some are dissected
for experiments, but the vast majority are either slaughtered for food or die in
farms before they're old enough to be purposefully
slaughtered.[](#)<sup>[2]</sup>

That doesn't mean there are trillions of animals in farms at any given time, as
the lifespan of these animals is often less than a year. There are probably
around 120–210 billion vertebrates alive in farms at any given
time.[](#)<sup>[3]</sup>

If we include *invertebrates* (e.g. octopuses, insects, crabs, snails, shrimp) —
which is more controversial because we have less evidence of their ability to
feel pain — it's more like 1.6–4.5 trillion farmed animals killed per year, and
around 350–700 billion animals alive in farms at any given time.

It's much harder to estimate how many of these animals are in *factory* farms.
In part, this is because 'factory farming' doesn't have a clear definition.
Generally, we'd say something is a *factory farm* if it has generally poor
welfare conditions and a large number of animals in a small space ('high
stocking density').

Rather than drawing a clear distinction, we'll go through how different animals
tend to be treated on farms and note any key variations, such as in standards
between countries[](#)<sup>[4]</sup> or what it means for hens to be 'cage
free.'

We *don't* to focus on animals that aren't farmed — [wild animal
welfare](https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/wild-animal-welfare/) and
animals killed by fishing and hunting are whole separate
issues.[](#)<sup>[5]</sup>

This table shows some estimates for various species. For vertebrates, we've only
included species where we farm more than 100 million animals at any one time
(so, for example, frogs and turtles but not snakes or salamanders). We've
included data for all vertebrate species we could find – we farm many other
invertebrates, like cephalopods (e.g.
[squid](https://www.longdom.org/open-access/the-advantages-and-challenges-of-squid-farming-101283.html)),
and bivalves (e.g. clams, oysters), but we couldn't find any good estimates of
how many of these animals are in farms.
