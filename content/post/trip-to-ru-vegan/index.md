I'm here to review Ru (茹), also known as Pure Vegan, a vegan restaurant in Shanghai, which I
visited with members of Plant Futures DKU on a crisp Monday in December 2025.
But before I tell you about the restaurant, I want to talk about what makes a
meal meaningful.

Humans have been gathering around food since we first learned to control fire.
There's something almost sacred about sharing a meal, about the way
conversations unfold between bites, about how stories taste better when seasoned
with good company. And speaking of stories, my journey to Ru Vegan began with a
classic example of my own human fallibility --- ending up at Hongqiao Station
instead of Shanghai Station (which is closer) because I, predictably, forgot to
book my ticket in advance.

But here's the thing about Ru Vegan that made my transportation mishap feel
insignificant: when you walk in, you're immediately enveloped by a sense of
purpose. The space isn't just elegant and peaceful; it radiates intention. The
staff's warmth transforms what could be just another restaurant into something
that feels more like a sanctuary.

Ms. Zhang, the manager, spent two hours guiding us through their menu with the
kind of enthusiasm usually reserved for showing old family photos. Each dish
that arrived at our table was both a work of art and a testament to obsessive
attention to detail. Take their taro rolls, for instance. They tested ten
different varieties of taro to find the perfect one, and then, in a move that
perfectly encapsulates their philosophy, chose to bake rather than fry them. In
fact, there isn't a single fried item on their menu --- a small detail that
speaks volumes about their commitment to both health and flavor.

Let me tell you about their pizza, because finding good vegan pizza is like
finding a four-leaf clover in a concrete jungle. The cashew cheese and spicy
mushrooms source create what I can only describe as a harmony of flavors that makes you
forget everything you thought you knew about what pizza "should" be.

If you look at the photo of the amount of food we ordered, you may think it's a
bit less than what people usually order at a restaurant.  And you would be
right.  In an industry that often equates value with volume, Ru Vegan takes the
radical step of encouraging customers to order only what they'll eat. It's a
small act of rebellion against food waste that feels both principled and
practical.

But what truly moves me about Ru Vegan is how it represents a larger movement
toward mindful consumption. The chef abandoned a successful IT career to pursue
this vision. Ms. Zhang did something similar. They're all here because they
believe in something bigger than making more money.

Sometimes, when I'm trying to promote Meatless Mondays at our university canteen
and watching students hurry past with their trays of chicken wings, I feel the
weight of apathy pressing down. But places like Ru Vegan remind me that change
doesn't always arrive with trumpets and fanfare. Sometimes it comes quietly, one
thoughtfully prepared dish at a time.

I give Ru Vegan five stars out of five.
