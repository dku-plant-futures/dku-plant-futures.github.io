We had an amazing time at the **Hummus-Making Workshop** on October 28th! ðŸŽ‰ Thank you to everyone who joined usâ€”it was a fantastic evening filled with creativity, laughter, and of course, delicious food.

Participants enjoyed a live demonstration of how to craft both classic and unique hummus flavors from scratch. The tasting session was a hit, with many attendees raving about the variety of flavors and how easy it is to make hummus at home. ðŸŒ±

The event wasn't just about food-it was a celebration of plant-based living and sustainable eating, and we're thrilled that everyone embraced the spirit of the evening.

Thank you to **Ola** for organizing such a fun and meaningful event. We hope to see you at our next workshop! ðŸŒŸ
