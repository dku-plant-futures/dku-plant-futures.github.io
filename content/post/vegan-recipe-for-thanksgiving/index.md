A few weeks ago, we were invited to suggest vegan recipes for this year's Thanksgiving menu for the cafeteria.  
[Marseille Williamson]({{< ref "/about">}}#marseille-williamson-co-president) shared some excellent recipes,
which I translated into [Chinese](/zh/post/vegan-recipe-for-thanksgiving/) and sent to the cafeteria.  

Although I didn't receive any response,
the recipes are still worth trying.
Here, I'm sharing the summarized versions,
along with links to the original English recipes for reference.
