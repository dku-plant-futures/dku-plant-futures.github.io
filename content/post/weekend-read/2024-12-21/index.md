We've talked before about [Elizabeth Kolbert]({{< relref "../2024-12-08/index.md" >}}),
a writer whose words have reshaped how many of us see the planet we inhabit.
Her voice, sharp and measured, carries the weight of a climate in crisis.
This week, I read her latest book, [*H Is for Hope*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/181346625-h-is-for-hope),
a brief but potent meditation on the precariousness of our existence.

The audiobook, which I listened to, clocks in at just over ninety minutes.
It's far shorter than Kolbert's previous works. But that's intentional.
Ordinary citizens don't need endless pages of dataâ€”we need to feel.
To feel the crisis as something visceral, immediate.
Hope in saviour technologies, politicians, or billionaires is misplaced.
The only hope lies in action, in living as though our lives depend on it.
Because, of course, they do.

The book's structureâ€”an alphabet of vignettesâ€”feels almost whimsical,
each letter bringing its own observation, its own challenge.
It's a small, clever conceit, and yet it doesn't trivialise the message.
We can embrace creativity, Kolbert seems to say,
even as we reckon with a reality so stark it defies imagination:
we may not turn things around this time.

Kolbert doesn't shy away from the enormity of the odds.
But she also refuses to indulge in despair.
In fact, the chapter on D is the shortest, and it reads:

> DESPAIR
>
> Despair is unproductive.
>
> It is also a sin.

That's the kind of clarity Kolbert bringsâ€”concise, urgent, unflinching.
It's what we need, whether we want it or not.
I rate *H Is for Hope* 5 stars.
