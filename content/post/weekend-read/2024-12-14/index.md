Last weekend, I introduced [Elizabeth Kolbert]({{< relref
"../2024-12-08/index.md" >}}), one of my favorite climate and environmental
writers.

This week, Iâ€™d like to recommend David Wallace-Wells, the author of *[The
Uninhabitable Earth: Life After
Warming](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41552709-the-uninhabitable-earth)*.
This book really opened my eyes to just how serious the challenges of climate
change are. 

The idea of more than 2 degrees of warming by 2100 is grim, but I appreciate
what David said in [an interview](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/11/1196978511/nprs-book-of-the-day-draft-12-11-2023) about his book:

The key takeaway for me is this: no matter how tough things get, thereâ€™s always
room to make them less bad. Every ton of CO2 we stop from being emitted means
fewer lives lost in the future. Every little bit of harm we avoid makes a real
difference. 

Currently, Wallace-Wells writes for the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/column/david-wallace-wells).
Since this is mostly a plant-based diet blog,
I think his column 
[Food as You Know It Is About to Change](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/opinion/food-climate-crisis-prices.html) is especially relevant. 
([Link to the Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20241209012848/https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/28/opinion/food-climate-crisis-prices.html))
In it, he talks about how the global food
system is facing more hunger, climate risks, and price instability. He also
points out that innovations like resilient crops and plant-based diets give us
hope. At the same time, he stresses how important it is to push for bigger
changes and more investment to secure food for the future.

Hereâ€™s a snippet from the article:

> In a few decades, we may find ourselves having solved the industrial problems
> of warming, only to be confronted instead by a persistent set of challenges
> that seem pre-modern by comparisonâ€”how to extract more calories from less land
> and how to do so without bankrupting the earth and its soils along the way.

This kind of future might sound daunting, but I see it as a reminder of how much
power we have to shape what comes next. With thoughtful choices, collective
effort, and a focus on solutions, we can work toward a better, more sustainable
way of livingâ€”not just for ourselves but for the generations that follow.
