# Plant Futures Screens "Should I Eat Meat?" Documentary

On **Wednesday, September 11**, Plant Futures at Duke Kunshan University hosted a screening of the BBC documentary **"Should I Eat Meat?"** presented by Dr. Michael Mosley. We were thrilled to see an unexpected number of attendees join us for this eye-opening film! 🎥🍿

## About Michael Mosley 🕊️

[Michael Mosley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Mosley), who sadly passed away on **June 5, 2024**, was a renowned British journalist, producer, and presenter famous for his documentaries on science, medicine, and health. Originally trained as a doctor, Mosley transitioned to television, where he skillfully combined meticulous research with engaging storytelling.

## Key Takeaways

### Meat's Nutritional Benefits 🥩

Red meat is an excellent source of high-quality protein, iron, zinc, and vitamin B12. However, plant-based diets can also provide these nutrients if carefully planned.

### Health Risks of Red and Processed Meats 🚨

Studies highlight significant health risks associated with regular consumption of red and processed meats, including increased risk of heart disease, certain cancers, and premature mortality.

### The Conflicting Evidence Around Red Meat Consumption ❓

While some studies suggest even moderate consumption of red meat could slightly increase health risks, others found no significant effect on mortality when consumed in low to moderate amounts.

### Michael Mosley's Experiment and Results 🧪

Mosley adopted a high-meat diet, doubling the advised daily intake. Within a month, his cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and body fat all increased significantly.

### A Balanced, Predominantly Plant-Based Approach 🌿

Experts recommend a diet that is mostly plant-based, with moderate consumption of lean, unprocessed meats. A few portions of lean meat per week (up to 100 grams each) can be part of a healthy diet, balanced with a variety of plant-based foods.

## Our Opinion: Updated Insights on Plant-Based Nutrition 🌱

While this documentary was produced in 2014, nutrition science has continued to evolve. Today, there is a [consensus](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/nutrition-overview-0) among nutrition scientists that "well-planned vegan diets can support healthy living in people of all ages". The only exceptions are **iron and B12**, which require careful consideration.

### Iron Supplementation

For those following a vegan diet, iron supplementation is crucial:
- Plant-based sources include leafy greens, legumes, and fortified cereals
- [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6367879/) that vegetarians, particularly females, have a higher prevalence of iron deficiency and depleted iron stores compared to non-vegetarians.

### B12 Supplements

B12 supplementation is essential for vegans:
- B12 is not easily found in plant-based foods in sufficient amounts
- Even the B12 found in animal meat often comes from supplements given to animals
- The [recommended daily intake](https://nutritionfacts.org/topics/vitamin-b12/) of B12 for adults under the age of 65 is 50 mcg per day
  and 1,000 mcg for those over 65.

It's worth [noting](https://www.forksoverknives.com/wellness/vitamin-b12-questions-answered-2/) that animals do not naturally produce B12 any more than humans do. Therefore, taking a direct B12 supplement as a human is equally effective and environmentally more sustainable.

## What's Next? 🤔

For those interested in a more comprehensive and updated guide to nutrition, we highly
recommend **Dr. Michael Greger's [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Not_To_Die:_Discover_the_Foods_Scientifically_Proven_to_Prevent_and_Reverse_Disease) "How Not To Die"**. It provides detailed information
on how a plant-based diet can help prevent and reverse many chronic diseases and is a
great resource for anyone looking to improve their dietary habits with the latest
scientific research.

We are currently running a (very loosely) organized [book club]({% link
_posts/2024-08-26-how-not-to-die-intro.markdown %}) on it. Join us to explore the latest
findings in nutrition science and plant-based eating!
