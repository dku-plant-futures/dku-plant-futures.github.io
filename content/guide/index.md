### :rice: Third Floor (Chinese Food)

The canteen management is committed to offering vegetarian options with proteins for both
lunch and dinner. These options are available in both the Weigh-and-Pay and A-la-carte
sections.

### :green_salad: Second Floor

There is now a salad bar on the second floor from which you can choose vegetarian
ingredients. Note that among the three sauces provided, only the oil and vinegar dressing (油醋汁) is vegan.

At the Teppanyaki section, you can occasionally find fried tofu.
Check the [menu](#open_book-the-menus) for more details.

### :sandwich: First/Ground Floor

Currently you can order Vegetarian Noddles (素浇面)
Please remember to tell the staff that you want noodle with *vegan* soup.

Baguette bread available on this floor is dairy-free and egg-free, while the
bagel bread contains egg. The vegetarian sandwich may include cheese and
dairy-based sauce, but a vegetables-only version can be requested. Oat
milk is available as a substitute for dairy in coffee, at an additional
cost of 2 yuan.

The salad section now also sells fruit and vegetable cups.

### :convenience_store: FamilyMart

In the baozi/steamed bun (包子) section, two vegetarian options are available: one with
cabbage and mushroom fillings and another with sweet taro filling.

The Guandong Zhu (关东煮), or Kanto-ni in Japanese, offers vegetarian skewers, but it is
important to note that the broth is fish-based.

Additionally, plant-based protein snacks labelled as veggie meat (素肉) or dried-tofu
(豆腐干) may be found on the shelves. (Note that they are not always available.)

## :chopsticks: Tips for Eating at Restaurants in General

### :ramen: Noodle Restaurants

Noodle shops are a convenient vegan option, as noodles are cooked in plain
water. While most toppings may not be vegan, alternatives like Veggie Chicken
(素鸡) or tofu are often available. If vegan options aren't listed, request
veggie noodles—staff are usually accommodating. Noodle shops offer flexibility,
especially for travelers.

### :fondue: Hotpot Restaurants

Hotpot (火锅), originating from Sichuan, involves cooking ingredients in a
simmering broth. While broths are often beef-based, mushroom or water-based
options exist, making it vegan-friendly when paired with tofu and vegetables.
Chains like Haidilao (海底捞) offer vegan options, but always confirm the
broth's ingredients.

### :goat: North-Western Restaurants

Liangpi (凉皮), cold noodles made from wheat or rice flour, is a vegan dish from
north-western China. It’s served with cucumber, purple cabbage, chili oil,
vinegar, and soy sauce, commonly found in restaurants like Xibei (西贝).

### :croissant: Breakfast Restaurants

Baozi (包子), steamed buns, are a breakfast staple. While many fillings are
meat-based, vegan options like vegetable and mushroom are available.

### :dumpling: Dumpling Restaurants

Dumplings, made from wheat-based dough, are filled with meat, vegetables, or egg
and can be boiled, steamed, or fried. Vegetarian options are common, but vegans
should check for egg in fillings.

### :oden: Skewer Restaurants 

Skewers, whether grilled, fried, or boiled, are often customizable for vegans.
Popular places like Kuafu Fried Skewers (夸父炸串) and Yanhuo Makes Skewers
(烟火成串) offer options, but note that vegetarian and non-vegetarian skewers
are often cooked together.

### :rice_ball: Other Restaurants 

Standard restaurants often offer a variety of vegan dishes, including:

1. **Mapo Tofu (素麻婆豆腐)**: A spicy and savory tofu dish, traditionally made with
   ground pork, but can be prepared without meat for a vegan version.
2. **Three Treasures of the Earth (地三鲜)**: A hearty stir-fry featuring eggplant,
   potatoes, and green peppers, often in a savory sauce.
3. **Dry Fried Beans (干煸四季豆)**: Crispy green beans stir-fried with garlic and spices,
   offering a satisfying crunch.
4. **Garlic Broccoli (蒜蓉西蓝花)**: A simple yet flavorful dish of broccoli sautéed with
   garlic, highlighting the freshness of the vegetable.
5. **Sweet and Sour Cabbage (酸甜洋白菜)**: A tangy and sweet cabbage dish, balancing
   flavors for a delightful side.
6. **Sautéed Bok Choy (清炒小白菜)**: A light and healthy stir-fry of tender bok choy,
   seasoned simply to let the vegetable shine.
7. **Chinese Scallion Pancakes (葱油饼)**: Crispy, flaky pancakes infused with the mild
   spice of scallions, perfect as a snack or side dish. Note that these sold in grocery
   stores often contain lard.
8. **Shredded Potato Stir-Fry (土豆丝)**: Thinly shredded potatoes stir-fried to a tender
   crisp, often seasoned with vinegar and chili for a tangy kick.
9. **Braised Tofu (红烧豆腐)**: Tofu braised in a rich, savory sauce, often with mushrooms
   and other vegetables.
10. **Eggplant in Garlic Sauce (鱼香茄子)**: Soft, tender eggplant cooked in a fragrant
    garlic sauce, typically sweet and slightly spicy.
